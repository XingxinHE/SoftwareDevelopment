📌**What is the responsibility of software module?**

There are **3** functions.

- :one: The function <u>**perform**</u> while executing.
- :two: The function of a module to **<u>afford change</u>**.
- :three: The function to <u>**communicate**</u> to its reader.



📌**What Refactoring does?**

It helps the preceding 3 functions.



📌**Good Naming**

After reading this chapter, I found out a good name for variable is super important!!



📌**Split the Procedure**

An easy to understand code should be split into a clear function.



📌**Effect of Refactoring**

The structure of the program is isolated from parts to parts.

The program is much more easier to be changed.



📌**When should you to refactor?**

The answer is everyday! Clean your code everyday.



📌**Does refactoring important?**

Yes, it is super important. Because refactoring produces **clean code** which is the utmost importance. Before investing in principles and patterns, invest in clean code.



📌**Example of Refactoring**

Please refer to the following commits.

# 6.Programming Episode

📌**What is user story?**

It is a material and a context which illustrates the application of software vividly.



📌**Trick to Start from Scratch**

Start with the one with <u>**less dependency**</u>(easier to test).



📌**What granularity should be of an object in abstract?**

Focus on an object that actually has behavior, instead of one that just a data store. However, I kind of disagree with this. In Factory pattern, it is a good practice to make a class as a data store.



📌**Does UML diagram help?**

Sometime it does and sometime it does not. The following diagram is a chart drawn at the beginning.

<img src="img/image-20220201203956074.png" alt="image-20220201203956074" style="zoom:67%;" />

However, in the final neat design. There is no `Frame` class neither `Throw` class. The design is robust enough to handle this game.



📌**When is inappropriate to use UML diagram?**

When you create them without code to validate them, and then intend to follow them.⚠❌



📌**Why code is more important than UML diagram?**

Because he best design will evolve as you take tiny little steps, writing tests first.



📌**Code**

[Bowling Game Test](./codes/Cs/Cs.sln)



📌**Applied SRP**

The code in this section adopts the [Single-Responsibility Principle](#8SRP: The Single-Responsibility-Principle) which formulates **1** class for **1** function.

At the beginning, there are **2** responsibilities of `Game` class:

<img src="img/image-20220202100523607.png" alt="image-20220202100523607" style="zoom: 67%;" />

After applied the SRP, the **2** responsibilities are **<u>separated</u>** into **2** classes:

# II.Agile Design





# 7.What is Agile Design?

📌**What is "The Design"?**

> ​	UML diagram $\ne$ "The Design"

> ​	Source code $=$ "The Design"

The design of a software is abstract. You CAN'T list every details of the software. Therefore, the source code is "The Design". You can only understand fully and truly by reading source codes.





📌**Design Smell - The Odors of Rotting Software**🤮

You can smell the following odors when software rotting...

- 1️⃣Rigidity - the system is hard to change since every change forces other changes as well
- 2️⃣Fragility - changes cause the system to break in places
- 3️⃣Immobility - it is hard to disentangle[^1] the system into components that can be reused in other systems
- 4️⃣Viscosity[^2] - Doing things right is harder than doing things wrong
- 5️⃣Needless Complexity - The design contains infrastructure that adds no direct benefits
- 6️⃣Needless Repetition[^3] - the design contains repeating structures that could be unified under a single abstraction
- 7️⃣Opacity - it is hard to read and understand. it does not express its intent well



📌**What Stimulates the Software to Rot?**

<img src="img/image-20220131005946416.png" alt="image-20220131005946416" style="zoom: 67%;" />

The answer is "**CHANGES**"! Bit by bit, as the changes continue, these violations accumulate, and the design begins to smell.



📌**We Can't Blame on Changes!**

Why? **<u>Because the requirements are the most volatile elements in the project</u>**.

So? We should make our designs <u>**resilient**</u> to such changes and employ practices that protect them from rotting.



📌**Story 1 - Regular Developers Encounter Changes**

> ​	Customer Requirement Ver_1:

Write a program that copies characters from the keyboard.

> ​	Code Designed Ver_1:

The program can be divided into 3 modules:

- 1️⃣ the `ReadKeyboard` module
- 2️⃣ the `Copy` program which fetches `char` from `ReadKeyboard` and routes them to the `WritePrinter` module
- 3️⃣ the `WritePrinter` module

```c++
void Copy()
{
    int c;
    while ((c=RdKbd()) != EOF)
    WrtPrt(c);
}
```



<img src="img/image-20220131120317181.png" alt="image-20220131120317181" style="zoom: 67%;" />

> ​	Customer Requirement Ver_2:

The program reads characters from the paper tape reader from time to time...

> ​	Code Designed Ver_2:

You use `bool` to encounter such changes.

```c++
bool ptFlag = false;
// remember to reset this flag
void Copy()
{
	int c;
	while ((c=(ptflag ? RdPt() : RdKbd())) != EOF)
	WrtPrt(c);
}
```



> ​	Customer Requirement Ver_3:

The Copy program needs output to the paper tape punch.

> ​	Code Designed Ver_3:

You continue the last modification philosophy and make a `bool` for the output as well.

```c++
bool ptFlag = false;
bool punchFlag = false;
// remember to reset these flags
void Copy()
{
    int c;
    while ((c=(ptflag ? RdPt() : RdKbd())) != EOF)
    	punchFlag ? WrtPunch(c) : WrtPrt(c);
}
```



> ​	Summary

During this whole process, you complained again and again...😡 You almost want to leave the job...





📌**Story 2 - Agile Developers Encounter Changes**

The difference begins at the first incoming modification when the agile developers were asked to make the program read from the paper tape reader:

> ​	Code Design Ver_2:

The team has followed the **<u>Open–Closed Principle (OCP)</u>**. This principle helps the program can be extended without modification. In the future, you can add more `Reader`.

```c++
class Reader
{
    public:
    virtual int read() = 0;
};
class KeyboardReader : public Reader
{
    public:
    virtual int read() {return RdKbd();}
};
```

From the `Copy` program perspective, you can use select different `Reader`

```c++
KeyboardReader GdefaultReader;
void Copy(Reader& reader = GdefaultReader)
{
    int c;
    while ((c=reader.read()) != EOF)
    WrtPrt(c);
}
```



> ​	Why no similar implementation on the ouput?

The reason is simple. Because the change has not been encountered! You only modify your code once needed, otherwise the code would be **Needless Complexity**.



📌**How Did the Agile Developers Know What to Do?**

1️⃣They <u>detected the problem</u> by following agile practices

2️⃣They <u>diagnosed the problem</u> by applying design principles

3️⃣They <u>solved the problem</u> by applying the appropriate design pattern.



The interplay between these 3 aspects of software development is <u>**the act of design**</u>.



📌**Conclusion**

**Agile design is a process**, not an event.





# 8.SRP: The Single-Responsibility Principle



<div align="center">
    A classs should have only one reason to change.
</div>



📌**Why is <u>IMPORTANT</u> to separate responsibilities?**

- 1️⃣If a class has <u>more than</u> **1** responsibility, then there will be more than **1** reason for it to <u>**change**</u>⚠.
- 2️⃣If a class has <u>more than</u> **1** responsibility, then the responsibilities become <u>**coupled**</u>⚠.

Therefore, the coupling leads to <u>**fragile designs**</u> that break in unexpected ways when changed.



📌**Coupled Design - more than 1 responsibility**

<img src="img/image-20220202110953677.png" alt="image-20220202110953677" style="zoom:67%;" />



The `Rectangle` above holds **2** responsibilities:

- 1️⃣ it provides a mathematical model of the geometry of a rectangle. (for Computational Geometry Application)
- 2️⃣ it renders the rectangle on a graphical user interface (for GUI)



📌**Side Effect of Coupled Design**

1️⃣ we must include the GUI in the computational geometry application => linked time, compile time,⚠ etc.

2️⃣ one change leads to another => rebuild, retest, redeploy,⚠ etc.



📌**Decoupled Design**

A better design is to separate the two responsibilities into two completely different classes as the following.

<img src="img/image-20220202112303117.png" alt="image-20220202112303117" style="zoom:67%;" />



📌**What is a Responsibility? When should be separated?**

Answer to the 1st question: it depends.

Answer to the 2nd question: it also depends...



Considering the following `interface` for a modem:

```java
interface Modem
{
    public void dial(String pno);
    public void hangup();
    public void send(char c);
    public char recv();
}
```

You probably think the definition is quite enough: the responsibility of `Modem` is the responsibility of `Modem`

 But it can be sliced into the following:

- Connection Management
  - `dial`
  - `hangup`
- Data Communication
  - `send`
  - `recv`

<img src="img/image-20220202114505520.png" alt="image-20220202114505520" style="zoom:67%;" />



⭐In a nutshell, **<u>what</u>** and <u>**when**</u> should we do this?

<div align="center">
    An axis of change is an axis of change <strong>only if</strong> the changes actually occur.
</div>

Sooner will cause **Needless Complexity**.

Later will cause **Rigidity**.



📌**Compromised Separation**

The `ModemImplementation` class is still a class containing **2** responsibilities. 🙊 Sometime we <u>are forced to couple things</u> that we’d rather not couple... The compromised solution is to **<u>separate interfaces of decoupled concept</u>**.



📌**Persistence**

Binding business rules to the persistence subsystem is <u>asking for trouble</u>🙉. Because business rules tend to change frequently..

e.g.

<img src="img/image-20220202120149026.png" alt="image-20220202120149026" style="zoom:67%;" />

The Employee class contains business rules and persistence control. When facing with similar problems, try to use FACADE and PROXY design pattern.







# 9.OCP: The Open–Closed Principle



<div align="center">
    Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for
modification.
</div>



📌**What is Open-Closed Principle?**

Open: open for extension

Closed: closed for modification



📌**Example of not OCP**

<img src="img/image-20220203170027372.png" alt="image-20220203170027372" style="zoom:67%;" />

Because `Client` and `Server` classes are concrete.



📌**Abstraction is the KEY**

1️⃣OCP is NOT one-off[^5]. Because we meet changes, and changes will affect the abstraction for current OCP.

2️⃣There is no abstraction that is natural to all contexts! (still due to changes)

3️⃣Don't <u>over-"abstract"</u> the design(*Needless complexity*).But, we wait until the changes happen!

4️⃣"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me." To keep from loading our software with *Needless Complexity*, we may **<u>permit ourselves to be fooled once</u>**. 

5️⃣Resisting premature abstraction is as important as abstraction itself.⭐



📌**Primary Mechanism behind OCP**

> ​	Speak without particular programming language

- abstraction
- polymorphism

> ​	Speak with particular programming language (e.g. C++)

- **inheritance** = abstraction + polymorphism





📌**STRATEGT pattern on OCP**⭐

<img src="img/image-20220203170336287.png" alt="image-20220203170336287" style="zoom:67%;" />

The preceding is the diagram after applied OCP. One question left, why did we abstract `Client` as `ClientInterface` rather than `AbstractServer`?

Because abstract classes are <u>**more closely associated to their clients**</u>[^4] than to the classes that implement them.



📌**TEMPLATE METHOD pattern on OCP**⭐

<img src="img/image-20220203175155878.png" alt="image-20220203175155878" style="zoom:67%;" />

The policy functions describe some work that needs to be done in terms of some abstract interfaces. e.g. pure virtual functions in C++.



📌**Bad Practice violating OCP**

```c++
typedef struct Shape *ShapePointer;

void DrawAllShapes(ShapePointer list[], int n)
{
    int i;
    for (i=0; i<n; i++)
    {
        struct Shape* s = list[i];
        switch (s->itsType)
        {
            case square:
            DrawSquare((struct Square*)s);
            break;
            case circle:
            DrawCircle((struct Circle*)s);
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

In the preceding example, the `switch-case` block is violating the OCP. In the future, it requires lots of coding when modification comes in, e.g. triangle.



📌**Using polymorphism for OCP**

Detail code refers to [here](./codes/Cpp/draw_shape/object_oriented_design_solution/main.cpp).

```c++
class Shape
{
    public:
    virtual void Draw() const = 0;
};

class Square : public Shape
{
    public:
    virtual void Draw() const;
};

class Circle : public Shape
{
    public:
    virtual void Draw() const;
};

void DrawAllShapes(vector<Shape*>& list)
{
    vector<Shape*>::iterator i;
    for (i=list.begin(); i != list.end(); i++)
    	(*i)->Draw();
}
```

In the future, if I were asked to draw triangle, I can easily add a `Triangle::Shape` class <u>without touching other codes</u>.





# 10.LSP: The Liskov Substitution Principle

<div align="center">
		SUBTYPES MUST BE SUBSTITUTABLE FOR THEIR BASE TYPES.
</div>

📌**Barbara Liskov wrote this in 1988:**

If for each object $o_1$ of type $S$ there is an object $o_2$ of type $T$ such that for all programs $P$ defined in terms of $T$, the behavior of $P$ is unchanged when $o_1$ is substituted for $o_2$ then $S$ is a subtype of $T$.

<img src="img/image-20220204145107917.png" alt="image-20220204145107917" style="zoom:50%;" />



📌**What does LSP solve?**

OCP demonstrates **inheritance** is IMPORTANT.

LSP will introduce <u>**how**</u> to best use inheritance.



📌**Example of a Violation of the LSP**

A violation of LSP causing a violation of OCP!⚠

```c++
//A violation of LSP causing a violation of OCP.
struct Point {double x,y;};
struct Shape 
{
    enum ShapeType {square, circle} itsType;
    Shape(ShapeType t) : itsType(t) {}
};
struct Circle : public Shape
{
    Circle() : Shape(circle) {};
    void Draw() const;
    Point itsCenter;
    double itsRadius;
};
struct Square : public Shape
{
    Square() : Shape(square) {};
    void Draw() const;
    Point itsTopLeft;
    double itsSide;
};
void DrawShape(const Shape& s)
{
    if (s.itsType == Shape::square)
    	static_cast<const Square&>(s).Draw();
    else if (s.itsType == Shape::circle)
    	static_cast<const Circle&>(s).Draw();
}
```

Apparently, the `DrawShape` function is trying to use LSP which takes `Shape` as an argument. But it **failed**, and it is violating LSP and thus violating OCP as well... When a new shape comes in, we have to modify the `DrawShape` once again...



📌**Potential problem of LSP and its solution**

> ​	Problem

Since LSP asks for a `BaseClass` and `DerivedClass` relationship, a.k.a. IS-A relationship. Sometime, this kind of relationship would mislead ourself.

For example,  we are known with common sense, Square is a Rectangle. Therefore, square is a subtype of rectangle.

```c++
class Rectangle
{
    public:
        void SetWidth(double w) {itsWidth=w;}
        void SetHeight(double h) {itsHeight=w;}
        double GetHeight() const {return itsHeight;}
        double GetWidth() const {return itsWidth;}
    private:
        Point itsTopLeft;
        double itsWidth;
        double itsHeight;
};

class Square : public Rectangle{};
```

However, `SetWidth` , `SetHeight`, `itsWidth`, and `itsHeight` are <u>**redundant**</u> information since square is 1:1 size. 

> ​	Drawback

- Memory **Waste**: Considering in a CAD/CAE product, millions of squares take redundant bits will cause memory waste.
- **Confused** API: These functions are inappropriate since width and height of a square are identical.

> ​	Solution

The solution is obvious. We could override the `SetWidth` and `SetHeight` function.

```c++
void Square::SetWidth(double w)
{
	Rectangle::SetWidth(w);
	Rectangle::SetHeight(w);
}
void Square::SetHeight(double h)
{
	Rectangle::SetHeight(h);
	Rectangle::SetWidth(h);
}
```



📌**Who is the boss of LSP?**

The **clients**.

> ​	If we see it from the creator of `Square` and `Rectangle`

Everything seems pretty good so far.

> ​	If we see it from others, possible clients themselves

The test function will fail if we pass a `Square` inside.

```c++
void g(Rectangle& r)
{
	r.SetWidth(5);
	r.SetHeight(4);
	assert(r.Area() == 20);
}
```

Therefore, there is nothing wrong of current design. It only smells when it encounters such situation. Therefore, the boss of LSP should only be expressed in terms of clients.



📌**DBC - Design by Contract**

> ​	Why DBC?

Since LSP is quite unpredictable and unquantified, developers refer to **DBC** - design by contract.

> ​	What is DBC?

 The <u>**contract of that class is explicitly stated**</u>. 

> ​	What does it state?

- **precondition**, must be true in order for the method to execute.

- **postcondition**, which is guaranteed to be true by method.

> ​	Example

precondition

```c++
// A rectangle
Rectangle r;
```

method

```c++
Rectangle::SetWidth(double w);
```

postcondition

```c++
assert((itsWidth == w) && (itsHeight == old.itsHeight));
```



📌**DBC meets changes**

> ​	Rules

The precondition of <u>derived</u> class: can be stronger or normal  ($\geq$)

The postcondition of <u>derived</u> class: can be weaker or normal ($\leq$)

> ​	Example

`Square` is derived class of `Rectangle`.

The postcondition of `Rectangle` is `assert((itsWidth == w) && (itsHeight == old.itsHeight));`

The postcondition of `Square` is unset right now. Therefore, it is weaker.⚠❌

Therefore, it violates the LSP.



📌**Example - Customized `Set`**

> ​	✏Problem1

A commercial 3rd party library has container classes, e.g. `Set`. The `Set` has **2** following versions:

- `BoundedSet`, similar to array with fixed size memory allocation
- `UnboundedSet`, similar to dynamic array with no limit on the amount of elements

The author may **1️⃣in the future replace such class** into a more appropriate and efficient container class. 

> ​	🔨Solution1

Regarding the first problem, use ADAPTER method.

<img src="img/image-20220205173903046.png" alt="image-20220205173903046" style="zoom:80%;" />

```c++
template <class T>
class Set
{
    public:
        virtual void Add(const T&) = 0;
        virtual void Delete(const T&) = 0;
        virtual bool IsMember(const T&) const = 0;
};
```

By using the preceding interface, the client code needn't to care which set it used. They only focus on `Add`, `Delete`, etc.

> ​	✏Problem 2

Meanwhile, part of the 3rd party class 2️⃣**doesn't support template programming**. For example, if I want to use `PersistentSet`, I have to register `PersistentObject` first.

> ​	🔨Solution2

Therefore, we can take the following strategy - *delegate* the process.

<img src="img/image-20220205175624340.png" alt="image-20220205175624340" style="zoom:67%;" />

```c++
void PersistentSet::Add(const T& t)
{
	PersistentObject& p = dynamic_cast<PersistentObject&>(t);
	itsThirdPartyPersistentSet.Add(p);
}
```

> ​	⚒Solution1+Solution2 = All In One

It is to combine everything into a compact system.

<img src="img/image-20220205212122663.png" alt="image-20220205212122663" style="zoom:67%;" />



📌**Example - `Line` and `LineSegment`**

The `Line` here is a mathematical line which can extend to infinity.

The `LineSegment` here is a geometrical line whose length can be measured.

<img src="img/image-20220205215244547.png" alt="image-20220205215244547" style="zoom:50%;" />

> ​	Problem

With common sense, the `LineSegment` is a derived class of `Line`.

```c++
class Line
{
    public:
        Line(const Point& p1, const Point& p2);
        double GetSlope() const;
        double GetIntercept() const;               // pay attention to here!! Y Intercept
        Point GetP1() const {return itsP1;};
        Point GetP2() const {return itsP2;};
        virtual bool IsOn(const Point&) const;     // pay attention to here!!
    private:
        Point itsP1;
        Point itsP2;
};

class LineSegment : public Line
{
    public:
        LineSegment(const Point& p1, const Point& p2);
        double GetLength() const;
        virtual bool IsOn(const Point&) const;
};
```

The `LineSegment` is a derivative of `Line`. The `IsOn()` method is set to `virtual` and everything seems ok. But if I do this on `LineSegment` will fail⚠❌:

```c++
Assert(IsOn(Intercept()) == true);
```

<img src="img/image-20220207141307252.png" alt="image-20220207141307252" style="zoom:50%;" />

Apparently, the intersection point(red🔴) of `LineSegment` may be not on itself.

> ​	Solution

Therefore, we could see a division here. `Line` cannot be the base class of `LineSegment`. Then the strategy shifts to segregate the `Line` into a `LinearObject` class.

```c++
//------------linearobj.h------------//
#ifndef GEOMETRY_LINEAR_OBJECT_H
#define GEOMETRY_LINEAR_OBJECT_H
#include "point.h"

class LinearObject
{
        public:
                LinearObject(const Point& p1, const Point& p2);
                double GetSlope() const;
                double GetIntercept() const;
                Point GetP1() const {return itsP1;};
                Point GetP2() const {return itsP2;};
                virtual int IsOn(const Point&) const = 0; // abstract. (pure virtual function is abstract)

        private:
                Point itsP1;
                Point itsP2;
};

#endif


//------------lineseg.h------------//
#ifndef GEOMETRY_LINESEGMENT_H
#define GEOMETRY_LINESEGMENT_H
#include "point.h"
#include "linearobj.h"

class LineSegment : public LinearObject
{
        public:
                LineSegment(const Point& p1, const Point& p2);
                double GetLength() const;
                virtual bool IsOn(const Point&) const;
};

#endif


//------------line.h------------//
#ifndef GEOMETRY_LINE_H
#define GEOMETRY_LINE_H
#include "point.h"
#include "linearobj.h"

class Line : public LinearObject
{
	public:
		Line(const Point& p1, const Point& p2);
		virtual bool IsOn(const Point&) const;
};

#endif
```





📌**Rules learned from previous example**⭐⭐⭐

We can state that if a set of classes all support *a common responsibility*, **<u>they should inherit that responsibility from a common superclass</u>**. If a common superclass does not already exist, create one, and move the common responsibilities to it.



📌**Heuristics and Conventions**

A derivative that <u>does less than its base</u> is usually not substitutable for that base, and therefore violates the LSP. Base class should do more than derived class.



📌**What is Degenerate function?**

A function in Base Class while it won't be used in Derived Class.





# 11.DIP: The Dependency-Inversion Principle

<div align="center">
		a. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.<br>b. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
</div>



📌**Bad Example of *high depends on low***

📌**Good Example - Inversion of Ownership**

By inverting dependencies, we have created a structure, which is simultaneously more flexible, durable, and mobile.

<img src="img/image-20220207145431276.png" alt="image-20220207145431276" style="zoom:70%;" />





📌**Example**

A system such that the `Button` object controls the `Lamp` object.

<img src="img/image-20220207145915200.png" alt="image-20220207145915200" style="zoom:80%;" />

> ​	Problem

There are several issues here need to be addressed.

1️⃣The `Button` class depends **directly**🤢 on the `Lamp` class. Therefore, changes of  `Lamp` object will affect `Button` object directly.

2️⃣Due to the dependency on concrete class, the `Button` can now only control `Lamp` class☹. It cannot control `Motor` class for instance.

```java
public class Button
{
    private Lamp itsLamp;
    public void poll()
    {
        if (/*some condition*/)
        itsLamp.turnOn();
    }
}
```

To conclude, **the problem is** the high-level policy of the application <u>**has not been separated**</u> from the low level implementation.

> ​	Solution

The solution is to **<u>find the underlying abstraction</u>**. It is the abstraction that underlies the application, the truths that do not vary when the details are changed.

For example, the `Button` remains unchanged:

- `Button`
  - `MouseButton`
  - `KeyboardButton`
  - `EletricButton`

- `ObjectLinksToButton`
  - `Lamp`
  - `Fan`
  - `AirConditioning`

The preceding diagram illustrates inverting the dependency on the `Lamp` object.





# 12.ISP: The Interface-Segregation Principle

<div align="center">
    Clients should not be forced to depend on method that they do not use.
</div>

📌**Why should we avoid such *fat* interfaces?**

With multiple inheritance, the useless method will be accumulated and turn into *fat* interfaces.



📌**Example of *fat* interface**

Suppose you have a door and you want to add a timer function which will automatically close the door once timeout.

> ​	Basic Door

```c++
class Door
{
    public:
        virtual void Lock() = 0;
        virtual void Unlock() = 0;
        virtual bool IsDoorOpen() = 0;
};
```

> ​	Timer

```c++
class Timer
{
	public:
		void Register(int timeout, TimerClient* client);
};
```

> ​	Timer Client

```c++
class TimerClient
{
	public:
		virtual void TimeOut() = 0;
};
```

> ​	Design of a timer door

<img src="img/image-20220207170516307.png" alt="image-20220207170516307" style="zoom:80%;" />



> ​	Problem

The problem is that the `Door` class now depends on `TimerClient`. But not all varieties of `Door` need timing❌😑. This violates LSP with a smell of *Needless Complexity* and *Needless Redundancy*. The `Door` has been polluted with a method not requried.



📌**Solution1 - Separation through Delegation**

<img src="img/image-20220207171156514.png" alt="image-20220207171156514" style="zoom:67%;" />

```c++
class TimedDoor : public Door
{
	public:
		virtual void DoorTimeOut(int timeOutId);
};

class DoorTimerAdapter : public TimerClient
{
    public:
        DoorTimerAdapter(TimedDoor& theDoor)
        : itsTimedDoor(theDoor)
        {}
    
        virtual void TimeOut(int timeOutId) {itsTimedDoor.DoorTimeOut(timeOutId);}
    private:
        TimedDoor& itsTimedDoor;
};
```

Well, there is *1* inelegant design. That is it involves the creation of a new object every time we wish to register a time-out.



📌**Solution2 - Separation through Multiple Inheritance**

<img src="img/image-20220207175429588.png" alt="image-20220207175429588" style="zoom:80%;" />

```C++
class TimedDoor : public Door, public TimerClient
{
	public:
		virtual void TimeOut(int timeOutId);
};
```



📌**Conclusion**

> ​	Problem

Fat classes cause bizarre and harmful <u>couplings</u> between their clients. When one client forces a change on the fat
class, <u>all the other clients are affected</u>. 

> ​	Strategy

Clients should only have to depend on methods that they actually call.

> ​	Solutions

1️⃣Breaking the interface of the fat class into many client-specific interfaces. 

2️⃣Each client-specific interface declares only those functions that its particular client, or client group, invoke. 

3️⃣The fat class inherit all the client-specific interfaces and implement them. 

> ​	Result

This breaks the dependence of the clients on methods that they don’t invoke, and it allows the clients to be independent of each other.

📌**What is the responsibility of software module?**

There are **3** functions.

- :one: The function <u>**perform**</u> while executing.
- :two: The function of a module to **<u>afford change</u>**.
- :three: The function to <u>**communicate**</u> to its reader.



📌**What Refactoring does?**

It helps the preceding 3 functions.



📌**Good Naming**

After reading this chapter, I found out a good name for variable is super important!!



📌**Split the Procedure**

An easy to understand code should be split into a clear function.



📌**Effect of Refactoring**

The structure of the program is isolated from parts to parts.

The program is much more easier to be changed.



📌**When should you to refactor?**

The answer is everyday! Clean your code everyday.



📌**Does refactoring important?**

Yes, it is super important. Because refactoring produces **clean code** which is the utmost importance. Before investing in principles and patterns, invest in clean code.



📌**Example of Refactoring**

# 6.Programming Episode

📌**What is user story?**

It is a material and a context which illustrates the application of software vividly.



📌**Trick to Start from Scratch**

Start with the one with <u>**less dependency**</u>(easier to test).



📌**What granularity should be of an object in abstract?**

Focus on an object that actually has behavior, instead of one that just a data store. However, I kind of disagree with this. In Factory pattern, it is a good practice to make a class as a data store.



📌**Does UML diagram help?**

Sometime it does and sometime it does not. The following diagram is a chart drawn at the beginning.

<img src="img/image-20220201203956074.png" alt="image-20220201203956074" style="zoom:67%;" />

However, in the final neat design. There is no `Frame` class neither `Throw` class. The design is robust enough to handle this game.



📌**When is inappropriate to use UML diagram?**

When you create them without code to validate them, and then intend to follow them.⚠❌



📌**Why code is more important than UML diagram?**

Because he best design will evolve as you take tiny little steps, writing tests first.



📌**Code**

[Bowling Game Test](./codes/Cs/Cs.sln)



📌**Applied SRP**

The code in this section adopts the [Single-Responsibility Principle](#8SRP: The Single-Responsibility-Principle) which formulates **1** class for **1** function.

At the beginning, there are **2** responsibilities of `Game` class:

<img src="img/image-20220202100523607.png" alt="image-20220202100523607" style="zoom: 67%;" />

After applied the SRP, the **2** responsibilities are **<u>separated</u>** into **2** classes:

# II.Agile Design





# 7.What is Agile Design?

📌**What is "The Design"?**

> ​	UML diagram $\ne$ "The Design"

> ​	Source code $=$ "The Design"

The design of a software is abstract. You CAN'T list every details of the software. Therefore, the source code is "The Design". You can only understand fully and truly by reading source codes.





📌**Design Smell - The Odors of Rotting Software**🤮

You can smell the following odors when software rotting...

- 1️⃣Rigidity - the system is hard to change since every change forces other changes as well
- 2️⃣Fragility - changes cause the system to break in places
- 3️⃣Immobility - it is hard to disentangle[^1] the system into components that can be reused in other systems
- 4️⃣Viscosity[^2] - Doing things right is harder than doing things wrong
- 5️⃣Needless Complexity - The design contains infrastructure that adds no direct benefits
- 6️⃣Needless Repetition[^3] - the design contains repeating structures that could be unified under a single abstraction
- 7️⃣Opacity - it is hard to read and understand. it does not express its intent well



📌**What Stimulates the Software to Rot?**

<img src="img/image-20220131005946416.png" alt="image-20220131005946416" style="zoom: 67%;" />

The answer is "**CHANGES**"! Bit by bit, as the changes continue, these violations accumulate, and the design begins to smell.



📌**We Can't Blame on Changes!**

Why? **<u>Because the requirements are the most volatile elements in the project</u>**.

So? We should make our designs <u>**resilient**</u> to such changes and employ practices that protect them from rotting.



📌**Story 1 - Regular Developers Encounter Changes**

> ​	Customer Requirement Ver_1:

Write a program that copies characters from the keyboard.

> ​	Code Designed Ver_1:

The program can be divided into 3 modules:

- 1️⃣ the `ReadKeyboard` module
- 2️⃣ the `Copy` program which fetches `char` from `ReadKeyboard` and routes them to the `WritePrinter` module
- 3️⃣ the `WritePrinter` module

```c++
void Copy()
{
    int c;
    while ((c=RdKbd()) != EOF)
    WrtPrt(c);
}
```



<img src="img/image-20220131120317181.png" alt="image-20220131120317181" style="zoom: 67%;" />

> ​	Customer Requirement Ver_2:

The program reads characters from the paper tape reader from time to time...

> ​	Code Designed Ver_2:

You use `bool` to encounter such changes.

```c++
bool ptFlag = false;
// remember to reset this flag
void Copy()
{
	int c;
	while ((c=(ptflag ? RdPt() : RdKbd())) != EOF)
	WrtPrt(c);
}
```



> ​	Customer Requirement Ver_3:

The Copy program needs output to the paper tape punch.

> ​	Code Designed Ver_3:

You continue the last modification philosophy and make a `bool` for the output as well.

```c++
bool ptFlag = false;
bool punchFlag = false;
// remember to reset these flags
void Copy()
{
    int c;
    while ((c=(ptflag ? RdPt() : RdKbd())) != EOF)
    	punchFlag ? WrtPunch(c) : WrtPrt(c);
}
```



> ​	Summary

During this whole process, you complained again and again...😡 You almost want to leave the job...





📌**Story 2 - Agile Developers Encounter Changes**

The difference begins at the first incoming modification when the agile developers were asked to make the program read from the paper tape reader:

> ​	Code Design Ver_2:

The team has followed the **<u>Open–Closed Principle (OCP)</u>**. This principle helps the program can be extended without modification. In the future, you can add more `Reader`.

```c++
class Reader
{
    public:
    virtual int read() = 0;
};
class KeyboardReader : public Reader
{
    public:
    virtual int read() {return RdKbd();}
};
```

From the `Copy` program perspective, you can use select different `Reader`

```c++
KeyboardReader GdefaultReader;
void Copy(Reader& reader = GdefaultReader)
{
    int c;
    while ((c=reader.read()) != EOF)
    WrtPrt(c);
}
```



> ​	Why no similar implementation on the ouput?

The reason is simple. Because the change has not been encountered! You only modify your code once needed, otherwise the code would be **Needless Complexity**.



📌**How Did the Agile Developers Know What to Do?**

1️⃣They <u>detected the problem</u> by following agile practices

2️⃣They <u>diagnosed the problem</u> by applying design principles

3️⃣They <u>solved the problem</u> by applying the appropriate design pattern.



The interplay between these 3 aspects of software development is <u>**the act of design**</u>.



📌**Conclusion**

**Agile design is a process**, not an event.





# 8.SRP: The Single-Responsibility Principle



<div align="center">
    A classs should have only one reason to change.
</div>



📌**Why is <u>IMPORTANT</u> to separate responsibilities?**

- 1️⃣If a class has <u>more than</u> **1** responsibility, then there will be more than **1** reason for it to <u>**change**</u>⚠.
- 2️⃣If a class has <u>more than</u> **1** responsibility, then the responsibilities become <u>**coupled**</u>⚠.

Therefore, the coupling leads to <u>**fragile designs**</u> that break in unexpected ways when changed.



📌**Coupled Design - more than 1 responsibility**

<img src="img/image-20220202110953677.png" alt="image-20220202110953677" style="zoom:67%;" />



The `Rectangle` above holds **2** responsibilities:

- 1️⃣ it provides a mathematical model of the geometry of a rectangle. (for Computational Geometry Application)
- 2️⃣ it renders the rectangle on a graphical user interface (for GUI)



📌**Side Effect of Coupled Design**

1️⃣ we must include the GUI in the computational geometry application => linked time, compile time,⚠ etc.

2️⃣ one change leads to another => rebuild, retest, redeploy,⚠ etc.



📌**Decoupled Design**

A better design is to separate the two responsibilities into two completely different classes as the following.

<img src="img/image-20220202112303117.png" alt="image-20220202112303117" style="zoom:67%;" />



📌**What is a Responsibility? When should be separated?**

Answer to the 1st question: it depends.

Answer to the 2nd question: it also depends...



Considering the following `interface` for a modem:

```java
interface Modem
{
    public void dial(String pno);
    public void hangup();
    public void send(char c);
    public char recv();
}
```

You probably think the definition is quite enough: the responsibility of `Modem` is the responsibility of `Modem`

 But it can be sliced into the following:

- Connection Management
  - `dial`
  - `hangup`
- Data Communication
  - `send`
  - `recv`

<img src="img/image-20220202114505520.png" alt="image-20220202114505520" style="zoom:67%;" />



⭐In a nutshell, **<u>what</u>** and <u>**when**</u> should we do this?

<div align="center">
    An axis of change is an axis of change <strong>only if</strong> the changes actually occur.
</div>

Sooner will cause **Needless Complexity**.

Later will cause **Rigidity**.



📌**Compromised Separation**

The `ModemImplementation` class is still a class containing **2** responsibilities. 🙊 Sometime we <u>are forced to couple things</u> that we’d rather not couple... The compromised solution is to **<u>separate interfaces of decoupled concept</u>**.



📌**Persistence**

Binding business rules to the persistence subsystem is <u>asking for trouble</u>🙉. Because business rules tend to change frequently..

e.g.

<img src="img/image-20220202120149026.png" alt="image-20220202120149026" style="zoom:67%;" />

The Employee class contains business rules and persistence control. When facing with similar problems, try to use FACADE and PROXY design pattern.







[^1]: disentangle: 解开,解耦, to separate something from the things that are twisted around it
[^2]: viscosity: 粘性
[^3]: It happens a lot in team programming. Ralph copied a block of codes which were copied by Lily which turns out to be created by Todd... and on and on... Therefore, the original idea of that code lost and hard to be maintained... Plus, if one got bugs and many places need to be fixed

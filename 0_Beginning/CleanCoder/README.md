# Preface

It is an attitude of **honesty**, of **honor**, of **self respect**, and of **pride**. It is a willingness to accept the dire responsibility of being a craftsman and an engineer. That responsibility includes

- working well and working clean
- communicating well and estimating faithfully
- managing your time and facing difficult risk-reward decisions. 


Most importantly, as an engineer, you must have a depth of knowledge about your systems and projects that no managers can possibly have. With that knowledge comes the **responsibility** to act.



An **idiot** will quit without having a new job, and quit emotionally.



# 1.Professionalism

## 1.1. What I ask for?

📌**What is Professionalism?**

It is a marker of **responsibility** and **accountability**.



📌**Core of Professionalism**

You see value of company as **same** as value of yourself.



## 1.2. Taking Responsibility

📌**Taking Responsibility even though it makes you feel awkward**

I should have taken responsibility and <u>told manager</u> that the tests weren’t complete and that <u>I was not prepared</u> to ship the software on time. That would have been hard, and manager would have been upset. But no customers would have lost data, and no service managers would have called.



## 1.3. Do No Harm

📌**Hippocratic Oath[^1]**

First goal and responsibility, of an aspiring professional is to use his or her powers for good.



📌**What is harm?**

Harm to both the **function** and **structure** of the software.



### 1.3.1. Do No Harm to Function

📌**What should I do?**

You must be **responsible** for your **<u>imperfections</u>**.

Write perfect software is impossible does not mean you aren’t responsible for the imperfection.

It won’t ever get to zero BUG, but it is your responsibility to <u>get as close as possible to it</u>.



📌**Try Your Utmost to Test**

Ideally, QA Should Find <u>Nothing</u>. Releasing code to QA that you don’t know works is <u>**unprofessional**</u>.



📌**You Must Know It Works**

You only write code because you expect it to get executed. If you expect it to get executed, you ought to know that it works. The only way to know this is to **test** it.



📌**When You Feel Hard to Test**

The solution to that is to <u>**design your code to be easy to test**</u>. And the best way to do that is to write your tests first, before you write the code that passes them.



### 1.3.2. Do No Harm to Structure

📌**A Good Structure**

It is able to make changes without exorbitant costs.



📌**How to Make a Good Structure?**

If you want your software to be flexible, you have to flex[^2] it!



📌**Are You <u>Afraid</u> to Modify Your Code?**

Why do most developers fear to make continuous changes to their code? 

> They are <u>afraid they’ll break it!</u> 

Why are they afraid they’ll break it? 

> Because they <u>don’t have tests</u>.



📌**When You Are Not Afraid**

If you have an automated suite of <u>tests that covers virtually 100% of the code</u>[^3], and if that suite of tests can be executed quickly on a whim, then you simply will **not be afraid to change the code**.



## 1.4. Work Ethic

📌**Bad Example**

<u>Woe</u> to the software developer <u>who entrusts his career to his employer</u>. Since your career is your responsibility. It is not your employer’s responsibility to make sure you are marketable.



📌**20 Hours per Week**

You should be reading, practicing, learning, and otherwise enhancing your career in your 20 hours per week.



📌**Minimal List for Every Software Developers**⭐⭐⭐

- Design Patterns
- Design Principles. (SOLID)
- Methods. e.g. XP, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Waterfall, Structured Analysis, Structured Design
- Disciplines. TDD(Test Driven Design), Object-oriented design, Structured programming, Continuous Integration, Pair Programming
- Artifacts. UML, DFDs, Structure Charts, Petri Nets, State Transition Diagrams and Table, flow chart, decision tables



📌**Continuous Learning**

Woe to the <u>architects</u> who <u>stop coding</u>—they will rapidly find themselves <u>**irrelevant**</u>. 

Woe to the <u>programmers</u> who <u>stop learning new languages</u>—they will watch as <u>**the industry passes them by**</u>. 

Woe to the <u>developers</u> who <u>fail to learn new disciplines and techniques</u>—their <u>**peers will excel**</u> as they decline.



📌**Practice**

Do a kata[^4] twice a day in order to **keep fingers used to hitting shortcut keys**, or using certain refactorings.



📌**Know Your Domain**

You don’t have to be a domain expert, but there is a reasonable amount of due diligence that **you ought to engage in**. When starting a project in a new domain, read a book or two on the topic.



📌**IDENTIFY WITH YOUR EMPLOYER /CUSTOMER**

Your employer’s problems are your problems. 别骂老板，别骂客户。



📌**Humility**

谦逊。



# 2.Saying No

<div align="center">
    Do; or do not. There is no trying. -Yoda<br>
    能就是能，不能就是不能。不要说`试试看`。 -尤达
</div>
**📌Dare to Say No**

Professionals speak truth to the power. Professionals <u>**have the courage to say no**</u> to their managers.



**📌Managers like people can say no**

Professionals are expected to say no. Good managers crave those has the guts to say no.



**📌Confront the Adversarial Roles**(clients or manager)

If you know fully well that <u>getting something done by tomorrow is impossible</u>, then you are not doing your job if you say "OK, I'll try"❌. The only way to do your job, is to say "<u>**No, that's impossible**</u>"!🙅‍♂️



**📌You are lying when you say "I'll try"**

Because you are crystal clear that the mission is impossible. Saying "I'll try" does not mean you are pleasing others, but rather you are **lying**!



**📌So-called "Trying"**

By promising to try means you have a new plan. If you do have a new plan, you have already used it. Therefore, **there is no "new plan".** Then, what is the difference you are saying "Try"?🙅‍♂️



📌**Dishonest**

<u>Promising to try is fundamentally dishonest.</u> You are <u>**lying**</u>🤥. And you are probably doing it to save face and avoid a confrontation😨.



**📌The Client Never Care As Much As You Do**

Does it ring a bell? The client said this is quite urgent[^6]! The clients, despite their protestations, despite their apparent urgency, never care as much as you do about the project...



**📌Be Honest to Yourself and Your Client, Don't be a Hero**

The temptation to be a hero and "solve the problem" is huge. What we all have to realize is that saying yes to dropping our professional disciplines is the not the way to solve problem. Dropping the disciplines is the way to create problems.



# 3.Saying Yes

**📌What is a Commitment?**

Say. Mean. Do[^7].

- You *say* you'll do it.
- You *mean* it.
- You *actually* do it.



**📌Recognize Lack of Commitment**

The <u>**bad**</u>❌😨 words:

- Need/Should. "Someone should make this happen." 有人应该要推动这件事。
- Hope/Wish. "I hope to get this done tomorrow." 希望我明天能完成这个任务。
- Let's. "Let's meet sometime." 让我们，让我们把这事做完。

In preceding example, people behave as if they were <u>victims</u> of a situation instead of **<u>in control of it</u>**.



**📌What does Commitment Sound Like?**

The real truth is that <u>***you***</u>, *<u>**personally**</u>*, <u>***ALWAYS***</u> have something that's <u>under your control</u>. Therefore, there is always something you can <u>fully commit to doing</u>. The pattern would be:

> ​	I will... by... (example: I will finish this by Tuesday.)



**📌It wouldn't work because I rely on person X to get this done.**😨🤥🙅‍♂️

You can **ONLY** commit to things that you have <u>***full control***</u> of. If the end goal depends on someone else, you should commit to specific actions that bring you closer to the end goal.



**📌It wouldn't work because solely I just won't make it**

OK. It's ok! At least you admit that you can't do it. The first priority then is to <u>**CHANGE the expectations**</u>, as soon as possible!!

- the earlier you raise the flag to all stakeholders
- you can change to a different commitment

If you don't tell anyone about the potential problem as soon as possible, you are not giving anyone a chance to help you follow through on your commitment.



📌A Serious Developer

If you follow the preceding principles, you'll be taken as <u>**a serious developer**</u>[^8] who lives up to their word, and that's one of <u>**the best things**</u> you can hope for in our industry.



**📌Responsibility to Maintain Certain Standard as a Professional**

As a professional, you have to make a commitment to maintain such standard. The code needs to be tested, the code needs to be clean, the code needs to be sure not breaking the system. Even in an intense and rush situation...[^9]





# 4.Coding

**📌What is the key to mastery?**

Confidence and error-sense.



**📌Dig out the actual need of a customer**

**Most of the time**, the <u>**customer's requirements do not actually solve the customer's problems**</u>[^10]. It is up to you to see this and <u>negotiate with the customer</u> to ensure that the customer's true needs are met.



**📌3AM Code**

Don't Code when you are tired!! Keep this in mind! When you are coding at 3.AM, you are not a hero.



**📌Readability**

Your code must be readable by other programmers.



**📌Worry Code**

When you have something bothering you, don't try to code at that time.



**📌Solution to Worry Code**

Spend a dedicated block of time working on the issue that is creating the worry.



**📌The Flow Zone[^11]**

First of all, it is not a good state. It is the highly focused, <u>tunnel-vision state of consciousness</u> that programmers can get into while they write code. When you are in the flow zone, you <u>**might be losing the big picture**</u>!❌

But it is OK when you are doing a kata.✔



**📌Pair Coding to Confront Interruption**

Pairing can be very helpful as a way to deal with interruptions. Your pair partner can hold the context of the problem at hand, while you deal with a phone call, or a question from a colleague.



**📌TDD to Confront Interruption**

The failing test can also hold the context of where you are. You can return to it after an interruption and continue to make that failing test pass.



**📌Take Good Rest**

Please get enough sleep.



**📌Creative Input**

Creative output depends on creative input. In short, read more books no matter what they are.



**📌Debugging Time**

To radically reduce debugging time is by adopting the practice of Test Driven Development(TDD). As a professionalism, you should minimize your debugging time.



**📌Pacing Yourself**

<u>Software development is a marathon, not a sprint.</u>



**📌Know When to Walk Away**

<u>Can't go home till you solve this problem?</u> Yes you can! And you should! Get your ass back home! When you are tired, they go away. If you then pound your nonfunctioning brain for hour after late-night hour trying to solve a problem, you'll simply make yourself more tired.[^12]



**📌Being Late**

The trick to managing lateness is <u>**early detection**</u> and <u>**transparency**</u>. Don't❌ continue to tell everyone you will be on time and then let them down☹... Instead, regularly measure your progress against your goal, and come up with **3** fact-based end dates: <u>best case</u>, <u>nominal case</u>, and <u>worst case</u>.



**📌Hope**

The "hope" here specifically means the "fake hope". If your client/manager expect the project will be done in 10 days, while you estimate is 15 days. Don't let up and let anyone else have hope.[^13]



**📌Rushing**

Good Practice✔:

> Say no to rushing. Hold your estimates! <u>The only way to improve the schedule is to reduce scope</u>. **Do not tempted to rush**.

Bad Practice❌:

> ​	Developer <u>buckles under pressure</u> and <u>agree to try to make the deadline</u>. The developer will start taking shortcuts and working extra hours in the vain hope of working a miracle. This is the recipe for disaster because it gives you, your team, and your stakeholders false hope.



**📌Overtime**

Don't agree to work overtime unless:

- 1️⃣ you want it
- 2️⃣ it is short term, like in 2 weeks or less
- 3️⃣ your boss has a <u>**fall-back plan**</u> in case the overtime effort fails



**📌Helping Others**

As a professional <u>you are honor bound to offer that help</u> whenever it is needed.



**📌Being Helped**

Just as you are honor bound to offer help, you are honor bound to <u>accept help</u>.



**📌Mentoring**

For senior programmers:

> ​	It is a matter of professional ethics to spend time taking young programmers under their wing and mentoring them.

For younger programmers:

> ​	Have a professional duty to seek out such mentoring from their seniors.
